Hi, I’m Diego, I am a Mechatronics Engineering student pending graduation in April 2023. I am interested in software development for robotics and I have knowledge of python, C++, and ROS. I have experience in mechanical and electronic design. I am a person that works well in teams but can work independently when needed. I am also looking to learn new things constantly, allowing me to take over new challenges. Anyone can reach me through email at diego98cs@gmail.com
